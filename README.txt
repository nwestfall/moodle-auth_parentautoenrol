This plugin was forked from @eSrem enrolmentor plugin. (https://github.com/eSrem/moodle-auth_enrolmentor)

This plugin works a bit different than the original (as well as being functional on Moodle versions higher than 2.6).  It allows student(s) in the system (using a custom field) to be monitored by another user.  The user chosen to be monitoring the student will be enrolled in all the same courses as the student(s), but with permissions setup by the administrator.  This way the person can see upcoming due dates, course documents, and anything else the students can see.

Tested on
	-Moodle 2.7
	-Moodle 2.8
